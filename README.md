# m0rehud edit

My custom m0rehud edit I used to use when I played Team Fortress 2 back in 2015, it was basically one of my first introductions to a programming-like thing that I have now transitioned into taking as a career path.

Some of the functionality and/or methods may be outdated or non-responsive, but as briefly mentioned above this was mainly made and mantained in 2015, with Team Fortress 2 having numerous updates since then that have probably broken some of the HUD elements.
